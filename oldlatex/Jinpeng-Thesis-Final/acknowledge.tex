I am grateful to many people, without whose support I could not have completed this
Ph.D. study and dissertation. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, 
Professor Priyank Kalla. He has been patient enough to teach me every knowledge I need to learn. 
I have learned many things from him, not only the knowledge itself, but also the way
how to organize the knowledge and apply it to real world problems.
Moreover, he is always available to discuss questions with me and 
provided perspectives based on his experience. I especially enjoy the brainstorming with him.
Actually, the most important result of my Ph.D. research is achieved by brainstorming.
Next, I would like to thank Professor Florian Enescu for
his extensive help and contribution to this work.
I would also like to thank the other members of my committee - Ganesh Gopalakrishnan,
Chris Myers and Ken Stevens, Rongrong Chen for their help and support.
Finally, I would like to thank my friends: Arun Jay, Sammer Merchant, Brandt Hammer for all the good times
we spent together.
